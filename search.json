        "另一方面，以火處理過的食物讓人更能利用食物中的養分。 哈佛大學靈長類學講座教授藍翰（R. Wrangham）去年發表研究報告，推測人類在190萬年前已經開始有意識地控制火、利用火了。那正是直立人剛出現的時候。不過，考古學家一直沒有找到那麼早的用火證據。",
        "第三個階段大概發生在七千年前，人類開始大量使用火並學會控制火。人類可能開始用火清地來發展農業，甚至用火來打鬥。雖然人類控制火的技術已純熟到可以用來發展農業，我們必須明白氣候還是大型火災發生的主因。 現今的人類似乎對自己控制火的能力",
        "人类用火历程是指人类在历史上使用火的演变过程，这一历程不仅标志着人类文明的起源，也是人类生存和发展的重要里程碑。通过考古学的发现，我们能够追溯到早期人类如何掌握和利用火的证据，了解火在文化、社会和技术进步中的重要性。 生成时间：2025-02-12",
        "不過在缺乏其他案例佐證的情況下，我們難以斷定這是否算是系統性的用火，還是偶然的行為。 然而，到了比較晚近的時期，系統性用火證據就比比皆是了。考古學家發現，四十萬年前住在以色列卡西姆洞穴（Qesem Cave）的早期人類，留下了很多持續用火的證據。",
        "人類對火的使用是人類科技發展和文化演化的轉折點，使人類的族群大小和棲息範圍得以大幅擴張。 火的使用令人類烹煮食物，並從加熱過的食物中攝取蛋白質和碳水化合物。 火又提供溫暖，使人類在寒冷的夜間，及至寒冷的氣候中活動。 火提供了天然光源外的另一選擇，也給予人類抵禦外來"

        "Other groups of researchers armed with remains from Africa, Asia and Europe have also claimed that human fire control originated very early—up to 1.5 million years ago. These studies, however",
        "We know that both early modern humans and Neanderthals had sophisticated fire technologies, at least some of the time. Despite the huge biases of disappearance and preservation, a new phase of early fire research is emerging in which interdisciplinary approaches offer the chance of addressing questions with increased success.",
        "The most popular theory is that \"our ability to make fire began long before the Neanderthals, as a spark —a single technological discovery that spread widely and quickly and has remained essential to human life, in an uninterrupted line, to the present day.\" New research suggests that hominins' use of fire came in fits and starts.",
        "For the vast majority of human history, visible fires were a crucial part of daily life. \"The first act of a day was to kindle a fire; the last act, to bank the coals,\" Pyne writes. \"And in between, fire was a constant companion.\" Naturally, the power of fire took on mythical meanings, often representing death and renewal.",
        "The Discovery of Fire. The exact moment when early humans first harnessed fire remains shrouded in mystery, but archaeological evidence suggests that it occurred at least 1.5 million years ago, possibly earlier. Early hominins likely encountered fire through natural sources, such as lightning strikes or volcanic activity."
